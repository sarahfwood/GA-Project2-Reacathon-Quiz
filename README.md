## Overview
My first hackathon, after completing our second module React.js. We were given 48 hours and allocated a partner to build an app of our choice that must consume a public API. This is my first experience at pair programming. We agreed on using a quiz generator API and set out wire framing and planning our approach.

## Technical Requirements

The app must:
​
* **Consume a public API** – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.
​
## Necessary Deliverables

* A **working application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
  * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
   * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome
